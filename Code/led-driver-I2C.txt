i2c

0) set TWIE in TWICR to 0 (we do not need interrupts)

TWINT set to 1 when we have to act.
TWAR, TWSR, TWDR must be used before putting TWINT to 0 (which start operation of the TWI)




MODE 1 set to XXX0 0000
MODE 2 set to 0X0X 0XXX (enable error status flag, grop control is dimming, output change on stop, not ack)
GRPPWM set to FF (full overall brightness) (or do not care as we set led mode in 10 (ignore overall brightness))
DMBLNK from MODE2 set to 0 (dimming control from GRPPWM)
PWM0-10 set to 0xFF (or another value for lower brightness)
GRPFREQ = XXXX XXXX (don't care, used in dimming mode)

LDR controls 4 leds at a time.
Leds will be used in 2 states : 00 (off) or 10 (on and dimmed through it's individual PWM)
LEDOUT0 : DDCC BBAA
LEDOUT1 : G'G'GG FFEE (we have an orange LED)
LEDOUT2 : KKJJ IIHH
LEDOUT3 : 0000 0000
